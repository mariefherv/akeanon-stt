This special problem aims to develop and establish a speech and text corpus for the Akeanon language.
\emph{{\color{red} To be followed by concrete methodologies and result.}}
% From 150 to 200 words of short, direct and complete sentences, the abstract 
% should be informative enough to serve as a substitute for reading the entire SP document 
% itself.  It states the rationale and the objectives of the research.  
% In the final Special Problem  document (i.e., the document you'll submit for your final defense), the  abstract should also contain a description of your research results, findings,  and contribution(s).

%  Do not put citations or quotes in the abract.
