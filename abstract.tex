Akeanon, a language spoken in Aklan, Philippines, is classified as a low-resource language (LRL) due to its limited linguistic resources and lack of digital integration. This research aims to develop and establish a comprehensive text and speech corpus, and build a model as a foundation for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for standardized Akeanon language. For the methodology, data collection will include compiling word lists for Akeanon based on the Swadesh 207 list and extracted text from an existing Akeanon-to-English dictionary. After compiling the word lists, their phonetic transcriptions will be encoded for the text corpus. For the development of the speech corpus, a selection of 1000 Akeanon words, having words from Swadesh list as priority, will be voice recorded from a total of fifty native speakers with varying gender and age. Audio resources containing the Akeanon language as well as their corresponding transcriptions that are available online will also be retrieved. The development of the speech and text corpus will be overseen and validated by a linguistics expert. A DNN model will be built and trained with Kaldi, using the newly developed corpus for initial results. This study aims to contribute to the preservation and digital inclusiveness of the Akeanon language and lay the groundwork for future works in developing an ASR system for the language.
