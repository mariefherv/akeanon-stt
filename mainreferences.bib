ABSTRACT = {To build automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems with a low word error rate (WER), a large speech and text corpus is needed. Corpus preparation is the first step required for developing an ASR system for a language with few argument speech documents available. Turkish is a language with limited resources for ASR. Therefore, development of a symmetric Turkish transcribed speech corpus according to the high resources languages corpora is crucial for improving and promoting Turkish speech recognition activities. In this study, we constructed a viable alternative to classical transcribed corpus preparation techniques for collecting Turkish speech data. In the presented approach, three different methods were used. In the first step, subtitles, which are mainly supplied for people with hearing difficulties, were used as transcriptions for the speech utterances obtained from movies. In the second step, data were collected via a mobile application. In the third step, a transfer learning approach to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey session records (videotext) was used. We also provide the initial speech recognition results of artificial neural network and Gaussian mixture-model-based acoustic models for Turkish. For training models, the newly collected corpus and other existing corpora published by the Linguistic Data Consortium were used. In light of the test results of the other existing corpora, the current study showed the relative contribution of corpus variability in a symmetric speech recognition task. The decrease in WER after including the new corpus was more evident with increased verified data size, compensating for the status of Turkish as a low resource language. For further studies, the importance of the corpus and language model in the success of the Turkish ASR system is shown.},

Half a century later it was reaffirmed as mainly a semivowel. Based on these descriptions of Akeanon, more questions arise as per the true nature of the phoneme in focus. This paper hence provides both a review and reevaluation of Akeanon phonology based on synchronic distribution, dialectology, historical accounts, and acoustic analysis. Results point to the phoneme as a velar approximant [ɰ].

abstract="Code-Switching (CS) is a phenomenon where a person switches from one language to another in a single conversation. In the Philippines, CS is used often due to multiple languages that coexist together in a society as it is a simpler way of conveying messages between its members. This study will introduce a method that detects code-switching, specifically in the Cebuano-English language. A support vector machine (SVM) with language parameters from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was used for language classification. An Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, consisting of Cebuano acoustic and language models, was developed to aid in the detection process. By combining language classification information and acoustic score, the method showed an increased accuracy of code-switching speech recognition compared to previous methods.",

abstract="The lexicon plays a pivotal role in automatic speech recognition as it is the link between the acoustic-level representation and the word sequence output by the speech recognizer. The role of the lexicon can be considered as twofold: first, the lexicon specifies what words or lexical items are known by the system; second, the lexicon provides the means to build acoustic models for each entry. Lexical design thus entails two main parts: definition and selection of the vocabulary items and representation of each pronunciation entry using the basic acoustic units of the recognizer. For large vocabulary speech recognition, the vocabulary is usually selected to maximize lexical coverage for a given size lexicon, and the elementary units of choice are usually phonemes or phone-like units.",

It was found that almost all the suffixes applied to each corpus were the same, but differed only in pronunciation due to the voiced velar fricative “ɣ”.

ABSTRACT = {Low-resource language (LRL) processing refers to the development of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and tools for languages with limited linguistic resources and data. These languages often lack well-annotated datasets and pre-training methods, making traditional approaches less effective. Sentiment analysis (SA), which involves identifying the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in text, poses unique challenges for LRLs due to the scarcity of labelled sentiment data and linguistic intricacies. NLP tasks like SA, powered by machine learning (ML) techniques, can generalize effectively when trained on suitable datasets. Recent advancements in computational power and parallelized graphical processing units have significantly increased the popularity of deep learning (DL) approaches built on artificial neural network (ANN) architectures. With this in mind, this manuscript describes the design of an LRL Processing technique that makes use of Improved Deep Learning with Hunter–Prey Optimization (LRLP-IDLHPO). The LRLP-IDLHPO technique enables the detection and classification of different kinds of sentiments present in LRL data. To accomplish this, the presented LRLP-IDLHPO technique initially pre-processes these data to improve their usability. Subsequently, the LRLP-IDLHPO approach applies the SentiBERT approach for word embedding purposes. For the sentiment classification process, the Element-Wise–Attention GRU network (EWAG-GRU) algorithm is used, which is an enhanced version of the recurrent neural network. The EWAG-GRU model is capable of processing temporal features and includes an attention strategy. Finally, the performance of the EWAG-GRU model can be boosted by adding the HPO algorithm for use in the hyperparameter tuning process. A widespread simulation analysis was performed to validate the superior results derived from using the LRLP-IDLHPO approach. The extensive results indicate the significant superiority of the performance of the LRLP-IDLHPO technique compared to the state-of-the-art approaches described in the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {The developed world has focused on Web preservation compared to the developing world, especially news preservation for future generations. However, the news published online is volatile because of constant changes in the technologies used to disseminate information and the formats used for publication. News preservation became more complicated and challenging when the archive began to contain articles from low-resourced and morphologically complex languages like Urdu and Arabic, along with English news articles. The digital news story preservation framework is enriched with eighteen sources for Urdu, Arabic, and English news sources. This study presents challenges in low-resource languages (LRLs), research challenges, and details of how the framework is enhanced. In this paper, we introduce a multilingual news archive and discuss the digital news story extractor, which addresses major issues in implementing low-resource languages and facilitates normalized format migration. The extraction results are presented in detail for high-resource languages, i.e., English, and low-resource languages, i.e., Urdu and Arabic. LRLs encountered a high error rate during preservation compared to high-resource languages (HRLs), corresponding to 10% and 03%, respectively. The extraction results show that few news sources are not regularly updated and release few new news stories online. LRLs require more detailed study for accurate news content extraction and archiving for future access. LRLs and HRLs enrich the digital news story preservation (DNSP) framework. The Digital News Stories Archive (DNSA) preserves a huge number of news articles from multiple news sources in LRLs and HRLs. This paper presents research challenges encountered during the preservation of Urdu and Arabic-language news articles to create a multilingual news archive. The second part of the paper compares two bilingual linking mechanisms for Urdu-to-English-language news articles in the DNSA: the common ratio measure for dual language (CRMDL) and the similarity measure based on transliteration words (SMTW) with the cosine similarity measure (CSM) baseline technique. The experimental results show that the SMTW is more effective than the CRMDL and CSM for linking Urdu-to-English news articles. The precision improved from 46% and 50% to 60%, and the recall improved from 64% and 67% to 82% for CSM, CRMDL, and SMTW, respectively, with improved impact of common terms as well.},
